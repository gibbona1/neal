# audio_labeler

TODOs:
- Instruction pdf to have open in adjacent tab
  - Make sure instructions say hot wo zoom in/out
- Get ~1 hour of files in 4/5 folders
- Default logged in users to their folder, if guest or cant find folder, use tmp folder
- Only I can use download labels button (admin)
- Display metadata (need location, can infer temperature, weather, wind, percipitation etc, habitat type from there)
- Make File Select dropdown easier to navigate
- File label stats (# labels)
- If keeping next/previous section buttons:
  - Little overlap between sections so boxes will not be cut short or duplicated
- Otherwise:
  - Scroll bar instead
  - If you haven't scrolled all (or most of) the way right, give warning notification about not seeing rest of audio file before proceeding to next 
- Label name should always be visible if box is on screen (not just top left)
- Metadatas (collapsible) under play audio
- <NULL> option shouldn't be visible in call type, file select etc
- Change colour of save selection button
- Any box with a label not in list doesn't show
- Extra button border colour light blue
- N+E Logo on login page
- Empty space "header" above save selection
